DataTypes:
    ->Are the categorization or classification of data items
    ->It represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed on a parrticular data

Built in DataTypes:
    ->Numeric Integer,float and complex
    ->Sequence type: string,list and tuple
    ->Boolean
    ->Set
    ->Dictonary

Mutable and Imutable objects:
    1.Mutable objects can change their state or content
    Ex:list,dict,Set
    2.Imutable objects cannot change their state or content
    Ex:Numeric,Float,Boolean,string,Tuple

List :
    Mutable objects
    ->is a sequence data type which is used to store collection of data
    ->ordered
    -> Allows Duplicate

Tuple : 
    ->Immutable object
    ->Used to store the values
    ->ordered

String :
    ->Sequence of characters 
    ->create a string using single quote,double quote or 
    ->for multiple statement triple quote

#f-string:
    -> to insert a variable's value into a string,
    -> place the letter f immediately before opening the quotation mark
    -> Put braces around the variable names
    ->Python will replace each variable with its value when string is displayed
    -> These strings are called f-string
    ->f-Strings was introduced in python 3.6 


range() :
    ->number of sequence
    ->start -> default 0
    ->stop -> excluded
    ->step -> default 1


while :
    -> while loop is used to execute a block of stattements repeatedly until a given condition is satisfied
    -> when the condition becomes false ,  the line immediately after the loopin the given program is executed
   Syntax:
        while(expression):
            loop body


#membership operators  :
    -> in (True) if value is found in the sequence
    -> not in (True) if value is not found in the sequence
    -> used to test whether a value or variable is in a sequence


Dictionary  :
    ->A dictionary is a collection of key-value pair 
    ->here , each key is connected to a value
    ->use a key to access the value
    ->Key Should be unique
    ->Mutable Object


Set : 
    -> Collection of items
    -> enclosed in {}
    -> each element is separated by , 
    -> Unordered 
    -> Mutable
    -> unique
    ->It returns the 1st duplicate


function :
    ->A function is a block of code that performs a specific task
    ->Functions are reusable pieces of code
    ->They allow you to give a name to a block of statement
    ->allowing you to run that block of code using specified name anywhere in your code
    ->this is known as calling the function
    ->the names given in the function definition are called parameters
    ->whereas the value you supply to the function call are arguments
    ->you define a function with def keyword ,then write identifier(name) followed by paranthesis and a Colon
 
Return :
    -> used to exit from a function and go back to the function caller and return the specific valu eor data item
